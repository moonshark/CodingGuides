# How to install Vue CLI with Webpack

In a new folder run this command:

```
npm install -g vue-cli
```

To create a new project you need to run the following. With the last word being the name of the project. Click Enter on each question that is asked. No for Sass.

```
vue init webpack-simple vuejs-playlist
```

To get started:
   
     cd vuejs-playlist
     npm install
     npm run dev

You will then see all of the files within the vuejs-playlist folder and a Vue JS landing page will appear.
