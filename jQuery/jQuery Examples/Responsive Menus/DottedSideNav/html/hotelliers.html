					<h3>4: Where can customers use AirPortr?</h3>
					<p>At present the AirPortr&trade; service will only be available between Heathrow Airport and London Hotels*. But rest assured, we will be expanding, launching the service in other major UK destinations. These include other London airports including Gatwick and City and cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Edinburgh. So, if you can't use AirPortr&trade; now, don't worry – we'll keep you updated and let you know when it's launching at a destination near you. <br /> <em>* hotels within the M25 (and Airport Hotels)</em></p>

					<h3>5: How can I make a booking?</h3>
					<p>You can either make a booking using our web based agent portal <a href="http://www.portr.com/agent">www.portr.com/agent</a> or we can integrate into your e-commerce site.</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq5 -->
				<article id="faq6" class="faq-result">
					<h3>6: How much does the customer pay?</h3>
					<p>We have kept this nice and simple. The customer does not need to worry about figuring out their bags weight and dimensions. It's one price for all sizes. They just need to tell us whether its ‘hand' or ‘hold' luggage so we know roughly how much space our vehicles will have. We have broken London up into 3 Zones (see zone map), so depending on which zone you fall into their first bag will cost either &pound;14.99, &pound;24.99 or &pound;34.99. Every bag thereafter is &pound;5 per bag, any size any number.* <br /> <em>* subject to fair usage Policy</em></p>

				<article id="faq7" class="faq-result">
					<h3>7: When will their luggage be delivered?</h3>
					<p>Our goal is to deliver their luggage within 4 hours of it being dropped off either at the airport or hotel reception. We can't always guarantee that their bags will be delivered within this timescale as we all know the inner-City roads can get busy. However, with our fleet running advance traffic monitoring and route planning technology we expect any deviation from this goal to be minimal. When using the Hotel to Airport service, we know that having the customer luggage at the airport well in advance of checking-in is important, so please bear this in mind when specifying their collection time (which should coincide with your airline's check-in requirements). </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq8" class="faq-result">
					<h3>8: Can I track where the customer's bag is?</h3>
					<p>Our website and mobile site will be packed full of great features to help you get the most out of your booking and the AirPortr&trade; experience, however one of our favourites has to be the real time GPS tracking of their bag. If you want absolute peace of mind, you can log into your account and watch it every step of the way on our user friendly map. Otherwise, you can choose your communication preferences in account settings, and we can keep you updated with their bag's process by text and or email. </p>

We know this all sounds very serious ...it's because we care about our responsibility to our customers. </p>
