					<h3>1: What is AirPortr&trade; and when will it launch?</h3>
					<p>AirPortr&trade; is a new product designed for the 21st Century traveller. We take the hassle out of that often stressful airport transfer, delivering your bags from the airport to your hotel, and vice versa, meaning you can make the most your day. Whether you're a businessman with a busy schedule or a family wanting to enjoy the sights of London, AirPortr&trade; is the luggage delivery service for you. We are looking forward to bringing the service to London later this year. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq1 -->
				<article id="faq2" class="faq-result">
					<h3>2: Why should I use AirPortr&trade;?</h3>
					<p>If we had to choose our top four reasons to use AirPortr&trade; they would be:</p>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Helpful.</strong> We make it really easy for our customers to book, pay and use the service. Keep it simple is our motto and is implemented from our pricing through to our communication keeping you informed every step of the way.</li>

						<li><strong>Safe &amp; Reliable.</strong> Every bag we handle is security checked, insured for up to &pound;10,000 and can have its GPS location tracked in real time through the use of our advanced technology. Our staff are trained to the highest standards. </li>

						<li><strong>Affordable.</strong> You get simple, transparent pricing and no unexpected fees or surcharges. We believe concierge services that make travelling a more pleasant experience should be affordable and available to everyone.</li>

						<li><strong>Flexible &amp; Rewarding.</strong> You can book either in advance or on the day of travel. We won't punish you if your plans change. You can even earn credits to redeem against future bookings either by referring us to your friends or as a valued repeat user.</li>
					</ul>
				</article><!-- / #faq2 -->
				<article id="faq3" class="faq-result">
					<h3>3: Where can I use AirPortr&trade;?</h3>
					<p>At present the AirPortr&trade; service will only be available between Heathrow Airport and London Hotels*. Rest assured, we will be expanding, launching the service in other major UK destinations. These include other London airports including Gatwick and City and cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Edinburgh. So, if you can't use AirPortr&trade; now, don't worry – we'll keep you updated and let you know when it's launching at a destination near you.  <br /> <small><em>* hotels within the M25 (and Airport Hotels)</em></small></p>
				</article><!-- / #faq3 -->
				<article id="faq4" class="faq-result">
					<h3>4: How can I make a booking?</h3>
					<p>Making a booking couldn't be easier. Either go direct on your PC, Tablet or Smartphone through our fully optimised Website (all modern browsers are supported). You can also book through any of our participating partners which include Airlines, Hotels and Travel Agents, details of which you can find on our Website. We recommend that you Register for an Account either before or after booking through one of our partners, to be able to experience all of our regular user benefits and collect loyalty credits to redeem against future bookings. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq4 -->
				<article id="faq5" class="faq-result">
					<h3>5: How much does it cost?</h3>
					<p>We have kept this nice and simple. Don't worry about figuring out your bags weight and dimensions. It's one price for all sizes. You just need to tell us whether its 'hand' or 'hold' luggage so we know roughly how much space our vehicles will have. We have broken London up into 3 Zones (see zone map), so depending on which zone you fall into your first bag will cost either &pound;14.99, &pound;24.99 or &pound;34.99. Every bag thereafter is &pound;5 per bag, any size any number.*   <br /> <small><em>* subject to fair usage Policy</em></small></p>
				</article><!-- / #faq5 -->
				<article id="faq6" class="faq-result">
					<h3>6: When will my luggage be delivered?</h3>
					<p>Our goal is to deliver your luggage within 4 hours of it being dropped off either at the airport or hotel reception. We can't always guarantee that your bags will be delivered within this timescale as we all know the inner-City roads can get busy. However, with our fleet running advance traffic monitoring and route planning technology we expect any deviation from this goal to be minimal. When using the Hotel to Airport service, we know that having your luggage at the airport well in advance of checking-in is important, so please bear this in mind when specifying your collection time (which should coincide with your airline's check-in requirements). </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq6 -->
				<article id="faq7" class="faq-result">
					<h3>7. Can I track where my bag is? </h3>
					<p>Our website and mobile site will be packed full of great features to help you get the most out of your booking and the AirPortr&trade; experience, however one of our favourites has to be the real time GPS tracking of your bag. If you want absolute peace of mind, you can log into your account and watch it every step of the way on our user friendly map. Otherwise, you can choose your communication preferences in account settings, and we can keep you updated with your bag's process by text and or email. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq8" class="faq-result">
					<h3>8. Is my personal information secure?</h3>
					<p>We take the security of your personal information very seriously. It is stored securely and we never, ever, share this information with a third party except where necessary to provide our service to you. See our Privacy Policy for more information. We also use a leading PCI compliant service payment provider who holds the highest level of certification given by card issuers (PCI-DSS Level 1) to store your credit card information. And if you think that sounds all official and very secure, that's because it is.</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq9" class="faq-result">
					<h3>9. How do I download AirPortr&trade; on my mobile device?</h3>
					<p>It's easy. Whether you have an Android or iPhone you can visit our website www.portr.com on your mobile. You will be prompted to download a shortcut for our fully optimised mobile site to your home screen. Once downloaded, click on the icon and follow our simple registration process then you're ready to go. We will also include a download link for the mobile icon in any email booking confirmation we send to you. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq10" class="faq-result">
					<h3>10. I have a promotional code - how do I redeem it?</h3>
					<p>Using a promotional code is easy, but you have to be booking direct either through our website or mobile site. When creating a booking, when you get to Step 3 'Payment details' – enter the promotional code you have been given and the discount will be applied to your booking before you are charged. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq11" class="faq-result">
					<h3>11. How do I collect and redeem referral or loyalty credits? </h3>
					<p>We like to reward  those who are loyal to us and are happy to recommend us to their friends, so we've developed a couple of schemes as our way of saying thank you;</p>
					<p><strong>Loyalty.</strong> For every 10 journeys you make we'll credit your account with a free Zone 2 journey worth &pound;24.99. </p>
					<p><strong>Referrals.</strong> If you recommend a friend or business partner and they book, you'll receive a credit on your account for 10% of the value of their booking. So spread the word!</p>
					<p>You can keep tabs on your credits earned in the My Account section (this can be found by tapping the Profile Icon at the top right of the screen). From there go to the User Dashboard and you'll see a balance of any credits that have been added to your account, and how many more journeys you need to do before earning your next bunch.</p>
					<p>To redeem credits against the value of a booking, in the same way as a promotional code, when you get to Step 3 'Payment Details' of your booking you will be able to select an option for 'Pay using account balance'. We'll then debit your account of any credits used and you enjoy a discounted journey!</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq12" class="faq-result">
					<h3>12. Can I book on the day of travel?</h3>
					<p>At Airportr&trade; we aim to be as flexible as possible, which means being able to book in advance, on the day of travel and even at the desk when you arrive at the airport, or are departing from your hotel. However, to ensure that we can always provide the service at the time that you need and to reduce waiting time at desks, we encourage you to pre-book your journeys. We wouldn't want to disappoint!</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq13" class="faq-result">
					<h3>13. Can I book multiple bags and journeys?</h3>
					<p>You can book multiple bags under one booking. You will also be able to add a return journey to the booking. However, in the event that you would like to add another journey (so different date, number of bags and destination), you will need to restart the booking process. If you register, this couldn't be easier. We will store your details in your profile so booking takes just a few clicks. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq14" class="faq-result">
					<h3>14. What if my flight is late will you wait for me?</h3>
					<p>Of course! You won't need to let us know that your flight is running late. Our system will inform us and we'll update your booking automatically. Just turn up at the desk when you arrive, where a member of our team will be expecting you. If your flight is cancelled and you either plan to travel on a different day or cancel your trip, please let us know by either amending or cancelling your booking through the Manage My Booking section of the website. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq15" class="faq-result">
					<h3>15. How do I know where to drop or collect my luggage in the airport?</h3>
					<p>Our desks can be located in the arrivals and departures halls of almost every major airport - although they are harder to find in some than others! So, to make it as easy as possible for you to locate the desk to use, we will include a Terminal Map on your booking confirmation giving you clear directions to help you find drop and collect locations. If you still can't find our desk, a member of the airport staff should be able to help you find us. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq16" class="faq-result">
					<h3>16. I have a question about my booking?</h3>
					<p>We give you control of your booking so you should be able to amend it, cancel it, track it, repeat it and reverse it without our help! This can all be done through Manage My Booking and the User Dashboard. But in the event that you do need to contact a member of our Customer Services Team then you can either email us customer_help@portr.com, contact us on Facebook, Tweet us @AirPortr_UK or call us on +44 207 5789316.</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq17" class="faq-result">
					<h3>17. Can I view previous journeys?</h3>
					<p>If you're a registered user, you'll be familiar with our user dashboard (...which we're very proud of!).  It lets you see a history of all of your previous journeys. You can also save them to your favourites list, to speed up the booking process in the future, select to repeat journey or to book the return! </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq18" class="faq-result">

				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq20" class="faq-result">
					<h3>20. How do I know that my bags will be stored and transported safely?</h3>
					<p>At Airportr&trade; we take security very (...very) seriously. Any luggage we handle is security checked in the airport and held in a secure CCTV monitored area before being collected. Our qualified handlers have been trained in careful and priority handling of luggage, and currently service some of the industries leading airlines. Our handlers are subject to strict interview processes and CRB checks. Our vehicles are locked at all times when in service, no matter how quick a drop is. Your bags are security tagged when in our possession making them incredibly hard to misplace and in the unlikely event that they are lost, they are easier to recover! We know this all sounds very serious ...it's because we care about our responsibility to our customers. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq21" class="faq-result">
					<h3>21. What happens if something gets damaged or lost?</h3>
					<p>In the unlikely and unfortunate event that something gets damaged or lost (either your luggage or contents) when in our care, simply report the damaged item to one of our team. As part of the Airportr&trade; service you get inclusive cover of up to &pound;10,000 per piece of luggage, so on acceptance of the claim, you will be reimbursed for the value of the damaged item. We will also give you your next Airportr&trade; journey for free to say sorry! Please refer to our Terms and Conditions section of our website for further details on how to claim and qualifications.</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq22" class="faq-result">
					<h3>22. What happens if my luggage doesn't arrive at the airport in time for my departure? </h3>
					<p>In the unfortunate and unlikely event that your luggage doesn't arrive at the airport in time for your departure flight, don't worry …it's not a total disaster. We have a global reach meaning we can get your luggage back to you pretty much anywhere in the world, via next day delivery! If you are travelling to a country outside the EU, a member of our Customer Service team will contact you to obtain a contents declaration (which should only take a couple of minutes!) and confirm to which address you would like your luggage sending. It could be your home, place of work, even to your neighbour. If your luggage is being sent to a country within the EU it's even simpler. We won't even have to go through the process of obtaining a contents declaration.</p>
					<p>We'll do our best to redeem ourselves by making the process as easy as possible for you, reassuring you every step of the way, and providing real time updates. In addition to an abundance of apologies, we'll also give you your next AirPortr&trade; journey for free!</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq23" class="faq-result">
					<h3>23. How do I get charged for the service and when?</h3>
					<p>You pay when you book, either directly or through one of our partners. If booking directly with AirPortr&trade; online, over the phone or at the airport desk you can make payment using any major credit or debit card (American Express, MasterCard, Maestro or VISA). If you are a registered user we can store your payment details to enable 'quick pay' in the future. If you are booking through one of partner hotels or airlines payment will be made to them when the booking is created. Payment methods accepted may vary. We don't charge you any card fees when booking, but we can't promise everyone else is this friendly!</p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq24" class="faq-result">
					<h3>24. What happens if my travel arrangements change?</h3>
					<p>It's not a problem. Airportr&trade; is designed to be flexible and to cater for your travel needs. So unlike many others out there we won't charge you any fees for advance booking amendments or cancellations – even when made on the day. So long as one of our vehicles hasn't started its journey to collect your luggage, changes to your booking won't cost you a penny. What's more, if your travel plans change because your flight is delayed or cancelled, we will update your booking accordingly for free. For more details see our Terms & Conditions. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq25" class="faq-result">
					<h3>25. How do I become a business partner?</h3>
					<p>Here are a few reasons we think every airline and hotel should partner with Airportr&trade;: Offer your passengers and guests something extra. Improve their travel experience, taking the stress out of the airport transfer, and allowing them to make the most of that often lost transit day. Be different. Offer something that your competitors don't. It doesn't cost you anything. There are no fees, subscriptions or long-term commitments. You earn money every time you create a booking for one of your customers. To register your interest visit our Home Page. </p>
				</article><!-- / #faq7 -->
				<article id="faq26" class="faq-result">
					<h3>26. What are the benefits of being a registered user? </h3>
					<p>We recommend that all our customers become registered users. It comes with loads of benefits and cool features. First is first, you'll receive one of our neat welcome packs with your own Airportr&trade; luggage tags and membership card. These can store your personal and booking details which means next time you use the service, dropping off and collecting your luggage couldn't be easier and quicker! Once your profile has been set up we can also save your favourite journeys and card details enabling 'quick-book' and 'quick-pay' options. You can also manage your communication preferences, choosing frequency of updates and media (email, text and or push notifications). Your Airportr&trade; service becomes the even easier to use, more rewarding and manageable lifestyle product we wanted it to be - essential for every time you travel! In terms of additional benefits we also give you the opportunity to collect loyalty credits every time you use our service and referral credits every time a friend books with us. These can be redeemed against your future bookings!  </p>
