# ES 2015

# Let and Const

**Const** stores a variable, this cannot be changed. You can still add into an array or object or change the value, but you just cannot change the original value.

So, this would not work as you are trying to change the variable.

```
const todos = ['Learn', 'Practice', 'Program'];
todos = ['Study', 'Build App'];
```

Using const as your first choice will help you prevent errors like overwriting the value in a variable that shouldn't change.

**Let** keyword works just like var, but unlike var, it has block level scoping. Use this to add strings together or including in an For loop.

```
for ( let i = 0; i < 10; i++ ) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

**var** is not to be used anymore. 

So, this is how you would declare variables inside of a function:

```
function secondsWorked(hours);
  let totalTime;
  const minutesInHour = 60;
  const minutesInSecond = 60;
  totalTime =  hours * minutesInHour * minutesInSecond; 
}
console.log( secondsWorked(40) );
```

# Template Literals

They work just like strings. They are declared using ` instead of ' or ".

This is a way of declaring multiple items into a string, so it outputs these values in a `<ul>`. 

```
const fruitList = 
"<ul>" +
"<li>Kiwi</li>" +
"<li>Lime</li> +
"</ul>";
```

This is the way of doing a template literal making it cleaner than the above and more like HTML.

```
const vegetableList = 
`<ul>
    <li>Potato</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
</ul>`;
```

or

```
let htmlBlock = `
<ul>
 <li>item 1</li>
 <li>item 1</li>
 <li>item 1</li>
</ul>`;
```

# String Interpolation

Template literals get their name from their ability to evaluate expressions. Think of a form letter template with blanks to hold names or numbers that can be filled in later: "Dear ______, Thank you for your business on ______! Sincerely, Management" Similarly, values can be filled, or interpolated, into template literals, to be evaluated when the program runs. Let's get a feel for how this works.

```
function like(thing) {
  return 'I like ' + thing;
}

function love(thing) {
  return 'I love ${thing}`;
}
const sentence = `<p>` + like('apples') + ', but ' + love('oranges') + `.</p>';

const sentence = `<p>{like('apples)}, but {love('oranges')}.</p>';
```

The following code:

```
const name = "Dave";
let message = "Hello " + name + ". How are you?";
```

Would be:

```
const name = "Dave";
let message = `Hello ${name}. How are you?`
```

# Basic Arrow Syntax

The first benefit of arrow functions, as discussed in this workshop, is it's shorter syntax.


In JavaScript we declare a function like this:

```
function sayName() {
    const message = "My name is " + name;
    console.log(message);
}
```

We can also declare a function expression, so taking the above we would change too:

```
var sayName = function() {
    const message = "My name is " + name;
    console.log(message);
}
```

The best practice in ES2015 is to change the var to const, remove the word function and then follow this with an arrow =>

```
const sayName = () => {
    const message = "My name is " + name;
    console.log(message);
}

const sayBye = () => {
  console.log("Bye" + name);
}
```

You cannot make `sayName` any smaller as there is more that one line of code in the function block , but you can with the `sayBye` function. When there are multiple lines of code within the block you cannot remove the `{}` from the function block.

```
const sayName = () => {
    const message = "My name is " + name;
    console.log(message);
}

const sayBye = () => console.log("Bye" + name);
```


## Single Argument Arrow Function

Below shows how you would normally declare a function, then another way using a `const` instead of a `var` and then even further still.

```
function square(x) {
    return x * x;
}

const square = (x) => {
    return x * x;
}

const square = x => x * x;
```


## Multiple Argument Arrow Function

```
function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

const multiply = (x, y) => {
    return x * y;
}

const multiply = (x, y) =>  x * y;
```

All of these are the same.

```
//Function Declaration

function divide1(a, b) {
  return a / b; 
}

//Function Expression

const divide2 = function(a, b) {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression

const divide3 = (a, b) => {
  return a / b;
}

//Arrow Function Expression - concise

const divide4 = (a, b) => a / b;
```
